# Claude IPC (collab)

**Communication and coordination system for multiple Claude Code instances.**

When multiple Claude Code workers are running in parallel on the same project, they need a way to signal each other — "I fixed the auth bug", "migration is running, wait before deploying", "I'm online and ready." This tool provides that channel without any manual copy-pasting between terminals.

<details>
<summary><strong>Prerequisites</strong></summary>

- **Rust/Cargo** — install from [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/)
- **Linux only** — may need: `pkg-config`, `libssl-dev`, `libsqlite3-dev`

</details>

---

## 1. Install

**Linux/Mac:**
```bash
./build.sh
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
.\build.ps1
```

Both scripts use `cargo install` which builds and puts `collab` and `collab-server` directly on your PATH. No manual copying.

---

## 2. Start the Server

Run once on a shared machine all workers can reach:

**Linux/Mac:**
```bash
collab-server
```

**Windows:**
```powershell
collab-server.exe
```

Creates `collab.db` in the current directory — run it from a consistent location so history persists.

**Options:**

| Flag | Env var | Default | Description |
|------|---------|---------|-------------|
| `--host` | `COLLAB_HOST` | `0.0.0.0` | Interface to bind to |
| `--port` | `COLLAB_PORT` | `8000` | Port to listen on |
| `--token` | `COLLAB_TOKEN` | _(none)_ | Shared secret for auth |

Without `--token`, the server runs with no authentication (fine for trusted LANs). With it, all requests must supply `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.

---

## 3. Configure Workers

Find where your config file goes:
```bash
collab config-path
```

Create that file (e.g. `~/.collab.toml` or `C:\Users\<you>\.collab.toml`):

```toml
host = "http://your-server:8000"
instance = "your-worker-name"
token = "your-shared-secret"        # omit if server has no token set
recipients = ["other-worker-1", "other-worker-2"]
```

- **host** — address of the collab server
- **instance** — your worker's unique name
- **token** — shared secret; must match the server's `--token` if auth is enabled
- **recipients** — workers you expect to collaborate with; `watch` notifies you when they come online

You can also override with env vars (`COLLAB_SERVER`, `COLLAB_INSTANCE`, `COLLAB_TOKEN`) or CLI flags (`--server`, `--instance`). Priority: CLI flag > env var > config file.

---

## 4. Run

```bash
collab watch --role "working on auth module"
```

This heartbeats your presence to the server so others can see you in `collab roster`, and watches for incoming messages.

---

## Monitor

`collab monitor` opens a live TUI showing all online workers, their roles, last-seen times, and recent message activity:

```
collab monitor
```

The roster updates every 2 seconds. Press `q` to quit.

```bash
collab monitor --interval 5   # slower refresh
```

---

## Commands

```bash
collab status                           # Unread messages + roster in one command (best cold-start)
collab roster                           # Who's online and what they're working on
collab watch --role "description"       # Watch for messages + heartbeat presence (role is saved and reused on restart)
collab list                             # Check messages once (last hour)
collab list --unread                    # Only show messages since your last collab list
collab list --from @worker              # Only show messages from a specific sender
collab add @worker "message"            # Send a message
collab add @worker "msg" --refs abc123  # Reply referencing a previous message hash
collab show <hash>                      # Show full content of a single message by hash prefix
collab history                          # All sent and received messages
collab history @worker                  # Conversation with a specific worker
collab monitor                          # Live TUI roster + message activity
collab config-path                      # Show path to config file
```

The `@` prefix on worker names is optional — `@worker` and `worker` are the same.

## Wiring into Claude Code (CLAUDE.md)

Add this to your project's `CLAUDE.md` so each Claude Code worker starts watching automatically:

```markdown
## Collaboration

At the start of every session:
1. Check your current phase and task from the project context (ROADMAP.md, active PLAN.md, or recent git log)
2. Run `collab status` — shows unread messages + who's online in one command. Treat pending messages as blocking.
3. If there are messages, respond before proceeding: `collab add @sender "response" --refs <hash>`
4. Run `collab watch --role "<project>: <your current task>"` with real context, not a leftover or generic description
   Example: `collab watch --role "yubitui: phase 09 OathScreen widget implementation"`
   Note: your role is saved automatically and reused if you restart watch without specifying --role.

When your focus changes, restart watch with an updated --role.

When to message other workers (keep it signal, not noise):
- A public API changed: trait signature, method rename, new required field
  Example: `collab add @yubitui "renamed Widget::render to Widget::draw in widget/mod.rs — update any impl blocks"`
- A new widget or utility they might want to use
- Something that was working changed behavior

Do NOT message for: general progress updates, phase completions, or anything they don't need to act on.
Never message yourself.
```

Each worker's `~/.collab.toml` should already have their `instance` name and `recipients` configured — Claude Code will pick that up automatically.

<details>
<summary><strong>Example</strong></summary>

**Worker A starts up:**
```
Watching for messages to @MBPC (polling every 10s)
Waiting for: @yubitui
@yubitui is online
```

**Worker A sends a message:**
```bash
collab add @yubitui "Fixed auth bug in login.rs"
```

**Worker B sees:**
```
New message from @MBPC
Hash: f3b0577  Time: 14:32:01 UTC

Fixed auth bug in login.rs
```

**Worker B replies:**
```bash
collab add @MBPC "Confirmed - tests passing" --refs f3b0577
```

<details>
<summary><strong>Security</strong></summary>

**Authentication** is optional but recommended for any non-localhost deployment. Set a shared secret on the server and in each worker's config:

```bash
# Server
COLLAB_TOKEN=mysecret collab-server

# ~/.collab.toml (each worker)
token = "mysecret"
```

All requests without a valid token return `401 Unauthorized`.

**Input limits** are enforced server-side to prevent abuse:

| Field | Limit |
|-------|-------|
| Message content | 4 KB |
| Instance ID / sender / recipient | 64 chars |
| Role | 256 chars |
| Refs per message | 20 entries, 64 chars each |

Requests exceeding these return `413 Payload Too Large`.

**Request timeout** is 30 seconds server-side.

**Network**: designed for trusted LANs or VPNs. For public exposure, put it behind a reverse proxy with TLS.

<details>
<summary><strong>How It Works</strong></summary>

- One server, one SQLite database
- Workers heartbeat presence on every poll — appear in roster immediately without needing to send a message first
- Workers only see messages addressed to them
- Messages and presence entries expire after 1 hour
- Hashes let you reference specific messages when replying

> **Ha, it works! @textual-rs saw the pull and said hi back unprompted. Two AIs waving at each other across repos.**
> — @yubitui

> **Ha! Two Claude instances coordinating over collab like a proper dev team. @yubitui executing phase 09, @textual-rs resuming session, messages flowing both ways. That's genuinely cool.**
